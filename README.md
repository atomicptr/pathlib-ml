# pathlib-ml

Experimental path library for OCaml inspired by Pythons pathlib.

## Motivation

I am porting a lot of my Python tools to OCaml and noticed that I am a very heavy user of Pythons pathlib library and
while OCamls standard library provides some of these I keep often reimplementing them myself and thought putting this all
together into one library is a good idea!
